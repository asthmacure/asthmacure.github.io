<h2>Psychology</h2>
<p class="disc">The following is for informational purposes only, consult a qualified medical professional before changing your treatment.</p>
<p>The research of Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer found that the onset of asthma can start with psychological trauma relating to territorial or scare conflicts. Such an event could cause paralysis of the bronchial muscles, which would be a natural response to being faced with perceived danger. When the body sets about the healing phase it reconstructs the bronchial muscles which may result in coughing, spasms and difficulty to breathe. All this serves to better enable mucus to be expelled from the bronchi.</p>
<p>Any such issues are likely to date back to childhood, or maybe past events now buried in the subconscious state. Although difficult, it may be possible to think back to the time when asthma symptoms began and recall any events around that time. Mentally linking those events to the onset of asthma can be enough to release the energy causing the recurring phase that starts the breathing difficulty. A two-pronged method of changing the <a href="/diet/">diet</a>, along with inner work and belief that it's possible to improve the condition could be enough to curtail symptoms.</p>
<p>This is an alternative way of looking at medicine, further reading on <a href="/references/">German New Medicine</a> is recommended when confronted with health problems of any kind.</p>
