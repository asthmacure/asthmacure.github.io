<h2>Psychology</h2>
<p>The research of Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer found that the onset of asthma can start with psychological trauma relating to territorial or scare conflicts. Such an event could cause paralysis of the bronchial muscles, which would be a natural response to being faced with perceived danger. When the body sets about the healing phase it constricts the bronchial muscles to prevent coughing and spasms, which produces a difficulty to breathe.</p>
<p>Any such issues are likely to date back to childhood, or maybe past events now buried in the subconscious state. Although difficult, you should think back to the time when you started to get asthma symptoms and try to recall any events around that time. Mentally linking those events to the onset of asthma can be enough to release the energy that is causing the reoccurring issue. In my opinion, a two-pronged method of changing your <a href="/diet/">diet</a>, along with inner work and the belief you can improve your condition could be enough to curtail symptoms.</p>
<p>I would recommend further reading on <a href="/resources/">German New Medicine</a> when confronted with health problems of any kind.</p>
