<h1>Asthma Cure</h1>

<article>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I was previously an asthma sufferer who has now been living without the symptoms for a number of years. I believe it is possible to recover from it and, eventually, not require drugs to manage it. Along with asthma I have cured myself of other related health problems, such as hay fever, allergies, eczema, dermatitis and polyps. I'm not a doctor, a nutritionist or a psychologist and I don't seek money for this. I don't claim to have all the answers, but I believe I have an obligation to publish my information and offer implementable advice.</p>
<p>Searching for any of the conditions above will return information about how to <i>manage</i> or <i>control</i> the symptoms. It's typical to be prescribed medication designed to suppress the symptoms while reinforcing the belief that it's a chronic condition. As a result millions of people are forever dependent on drugs, making massive sums of money for large pharmaceutical companies. General practitioners are mostly ineffective because they are trained to react in routine rather than by investigation, therefore they will fail to seek the real root causes for any of these health issues. The medical profession for far too has long been focused on symptoms and not the actual cause of disease.</p>
<p>My experience is that asthma and other inflammatory diseases are linked to the gut microbiome and that an imbalance can initially be caused by psychological distress. The impact trauma plays on human health has been vastly under estimated, as with the impact of gut health on autoimmune disease. A lot of this useful knowledge has been taken out of circulation, is difficult to obtain or exists behind paywalls. Simply put, it's possible to fix problems such as asthma by taking a holistic approach, including <a href="/diet/">diet</a> and <a href="/psychology/">mentality</a>. These principals can be applied to any malady.</p>
