<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>There is currently a raging debate over the consumption of meat and animal products, no matter your degree of polarization I encourage you to read on as there's always something to take away. You can divide the dietary steps to improve gut health into two parts - changing the type of food you eat and your efficiency to digest food.</p>
<p>The easiest and most effective step you can take right now is to stop, or at least reduce, your intake of carbohydrates. If you can't cut out potatoes, rice and pasta then eat decreasing amounts. I suggest you quit bread entirely but if you find this difficult then begin by changing to sourdough only - anything that has been fermented is at least easier to digest. Avoid products labelled as whole grain.</p>
<p>The common food pyramid that we are shown as a guideline is generally upside down. The bottom section recommends eating mostly bread, cereals and potatoes. This is completely wrong, consuming large quantities of fiber with carbohydrates is a sure way to slowly destroy your gut. Carbohydrates are sugars and you don't want to be reliant on sugar as your fuel. The next level of the pyramid advises eating a good quantity of fruits and vegetables. The human digestive tract cannot process plant matter, fiber is indigestible and overeating vegetables can cause stomach problems. Constant consumption of fiber will force your body to flush out all your minerals. When possible, juice vegetables and eat fruit in the most natural and rawest form, this will maintain the enzymes that help your digestive system.</p>
<p>Dairy products are healthy, but if you have a damaged gut you need to tread carefully as you may not be able to process them. You are the best judge of your tolerance. You may get stomach problems when eating and drinking pasteurised and processed dairy, this is because pasteurisation removes the essence of dairy. Never choose low-fat dairy products. If you can source raw milk it may be the most important addition to your diet. It is the most nutritious drink, it is naturally probiotic and it will maintain bacteria that promotes good gut health. Otherwise try to choose dairy produced from raw or unpasteurised milk. It is possible to buy unpasteurised butter and cheese in the supermarket. Eggs are one of the most important things and I'd recommend they are eaten raw when possible. I would attribute a big part of my recovery to drinking high quality raw eggs in the morning.</p>
<p>From a nutritional perspective, we thrive with animal-based products in our diet. The healthiest ways to eat meat are either raw, if it's been preserved by curing or fermentation, or if it's been slow cooked in a broth. Raw meat contains the most nutritional value, but it's consumption is unorthodox and should be thoroughly researched beforehand. It's also clear when meat shouldn't be consumed, if it's overcooked or tough to chew then you don't want it in your digestive tract. The curing and fermentation of meat has been practised through the ages - nature has already broken down the food, so digestion is easy. A good way to make a start with fermented food is to make sauerkraut, it's simple to prepare and highly beneficial to your health. It is very important to note that bacteria is entirely essential for the human body, it plays a role in natural detoxification and removal of dead cells. Having a lifestyle where you do not consume and avoid bacteria is antithetical to human health.</p>
<p>If you are beginning to make significant dietary changes, or you already have multiple health issues, then a great start would be to make bone broths. I recommend the steps explained in the <a href="/resources/">GAPS diet</a>.</p>
