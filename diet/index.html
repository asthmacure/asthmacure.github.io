<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>The following is for informational purposes only, consult a qualified medical professional before making dietary changes.</p>
<p>It is important to keep an open mind reading this section as not all agree with the consumption of meat and animal products. It may be possible for the vegan diet to be adapted somehow along these lines, but it is not something I have investigated. The dietary steps to improve gut health fall mainly in two parts - changing the type of food consumed and efficiency to digest food.</p>
<p>The easiest and most effective step to take is to reduce intake of carbohydrates. Not everyone can remove them from their diet immediately, but it should be the end goal. If it's difficult to cut out potatoes, rice and pasta then eat decreasing amounts. It is recommended to quit bread entirely, or at least change to sourdough only - anything that has been fermented is easier to digest. Avoid products labelled as whole grain or breads with seeds or oats.</p>
<p>The common food pyramid shown to us as a dietary guideline is generally upside down. The bottom section recommends eating mostly bread, cereals and potatoes. Carbohydrates are sugars and the body should not be reliant on sugar as fuel as this leads to low mood. The next level of the pyramid advises eating an ample quantity of fruit and vegetables. The human digestive tract is not naturally adapted to processing plant matter, fiber is indigestible and overeating it can cause stomach inflammation. Constant consumption of fiber forces the body to flush out minerals and can drain the body of important fats. Some raw produce contains enzymes that help the digestive system, but it is important to check for <a href="/references/">oxalates</a> because a high oxalate diet can lead to creeping health problems.</p>
<p>Dairy products are healthy, but if the gut is damaged more care should be taken to make sure they are processable. Stomach problems can result from eating and drinking pasteurised and processed dairy, this is because pasteurisation removes the essence of dairy. Never choose low-fat dairy products. Sourcing raw milk may be the most important addition to the diet. It is the most nutritious drink, it is naturally probiotic and it will maintain bacteria that promotes good gut health. Other dairy should be produced from raw or unpasteurised milk. It is still possible to buy unpasteurised butter and cheese in the supermarket. Eggs can be relied on for delivering great nutritional value and it is recommended to drink them raw in the morning, or whenever possible.</p>
<p>From a nutritional perspective, we thrive with animal-based products in our diet. The healthiest ways to eat meat are either raw, if it's been preserved by curing or fermentation, or if it's been slow cooked in a broth. Raw meat contains the most nutritional value, but it's consumption is unorthodox and should be thoroughly researched beforehand. It's also clear when meat shouldn't be consumed, if it's overcooked or tough to chew then it shouldn't be in the gastrointestinal tract. The curing and fermentation of meat has been practised through the ages - nature has already broken down the food, so digestion is easy. A good way to make a start with fermented food is to make sauerkraut, it's simple to prepare and highly beneficial to the digestive system. It is very important to note that bacteria is entirely essential for the human body, it plays a role in natural detoxification and removal of dead cells. Having a lifestyle where it is not consumed or embraced is antithetical to human health.</p>
<p>When beginning to make dietary changes or languishing with significant health issues, a great start is to make bone broths. The steps explained in the <a href="/references/">GAPS diet</a> would be a solid course of action.</p>
